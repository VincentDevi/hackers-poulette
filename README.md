# hackers-poulette

This project is a simple form to contact a support team.

I had to sanitize and validate the datas, to do so I have use a the rakit / validation library.

Here is the documentation of this library [rakit / validator](https://github.com/rakit/validation)

There is also a validation on the client side so you know what kind of data you have to send.

[Here is the site of the form](https://poupoulette.000webhostapp.com/)
